# Collect the Balls

## Overview
"Collect the Balls" is a simple game inspired by the classic arcade game Pac-Man. In this game, the player controls a character that moves around the board and collects balls placed randomly on the grid. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for better separation of concerns and maintainability.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the player around the game board.
- The objective is to collect all the balls that appear on the grid.
- Balls appear in random positions at regular intervals, and the player's goal is to "eat" them by moving over them.

## Project Structure
This project is organized using the MVC pattern:
- **Model**: Manages the game's data, including the game board, player position, and ball locations.
- **View**: Handles rendering the game elements (the player, balls, and board) in the browser using HTML and CSS.
- **Controller**: Manages user input and updates the game state accordingly.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Defines the structure of the game board and other elements.
- **CSS3**: Styles the game board, player, and balls.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, random ball generation, and user interaction.
- **MVC Pattern**: Ensures a clean separation of concerns between data, presentation, and user interaction.
